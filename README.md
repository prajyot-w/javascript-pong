# Javascript Pong

 This is a hobby project where I created a simple pong game using vanilla javascript.
 To play the game, just clone the project and open index.html file in any browser of your choice.
 
 I would love to receive any suggestions / improvements.
 
## Getting Started

  These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
  
### Prerequisites

  - Git Version Control
  - Web Browser ( Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer etc )
  
### Installing

  Download the code with following command.
  
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/prajyot-w/javascript-snake.git

### Instructions

    The dark grey box represents the game field where the game will be played. There are two paddles,
    one on left side of the field and other on right side of the field. You will compete against 
    computer. The left paddle is controlled by computer, whereas you control the right paddle.
    Use UP/DOWN arrow keys to control your paddle. If the ball move past any paddle, the opponent
    will gain a point. The game goes on forever so no clear winner.
